# CODEX Status

## Phase
- Current Phase: Phase 1 (refactor spine underway; initial structure + logging complete)

## Preexisting Audit
- WEBSITE_AUDIT_REPORT.md not found in repository; unable to summarize preexisting audit findings. Need source document to populate this section.

## Phase 1 Progress
- Established new application spine under `src/` (api, components/{common,catalog,booking,admin}, hooks, pages, routes, utils, types).
- Added shared infrastructure: `src/utils/logger.ts`, placeholder `src/utils/supabaseClient.ts`, `src/routes/ProtectedRoute.tsx`, `src/routes/AppRouter.tsx`, and `src/hooks/useAdminAuth.ts`.
- Migrated data access for catalog/admin flows into `src/api/tripService.ts` and `src/api/adminService.ts`; updated admin dashboard and products catalog to consume services.
- Split catalog list into modular components (`TripFilterBar`, `TripGrid`, `TripPagination`, `TripCard`, `TripsList`) powering `/products`.
- Replaced prior `console.*` usage with scoped logger instances across API routes, product detail page, email utilities, and tooling.

## Repository Inventory (snapshot)
- Large files (>300 LOC): `app/globals.css` (~424 LOC). Generated cache files under `node-compile-cache` remain out of scope.
- Dependencies (`package.json`): Next.js 15.3.3, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Stripe, Resend, Prisma 6.11.1, Playwright, etc. Monorepo packages under `packages/` (db, server, ui).

## Outstanding Gaps / Blockers
- Missing docs/CODEX_ORCHESTRATION.md manual; requested location unknown.
- WEBSITE_AUDIT_REPORT.md absent; cannot document preexisting audit issues until provided.
