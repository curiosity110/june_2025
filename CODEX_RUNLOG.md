# CODEX Run Log

## 2025-?? Session
- Phase 0 initiated; searched for docs/CODEX_ORCHESTRATION.md but file missing.
- Attempted to locate WEBSITE_AUDIT_REPORT.md; not present in repository.
- Collected inventory: identified large files, catalogued previous `console.*` usage, recorded dependencies from package.json.
- Created CODEX status/runlog/handoff documents.
- Established `src/` spine (api, components, hooks, routes, utils, types) and added shared logger + supabase client placeholder.
- Replaced `console.*` logging with scoped logger usage across API routes, product pages, email utilities, and scripts.
- Implemented catalog refactor: `TripsList` orchestrates new `TripFilterBar`, `TripGrid`, `TripPagination`, `TripCard`; `/products` now consumes `src/api/tripService` data.
- Added admin service layer + `useAdminAuth`, `ProtectedRoute`, `AppRouter`; admin dashboard now uses service calls and logger.
- Documented missing orchestration manual and audit report for follow-up.
